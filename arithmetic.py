        A (//) (double slash) sign is an integer division operator. It differs from the standard (/) operator in two details:

                    (i)    its result lacks the fractional part 
                                - it's absent (for integers).
                                - and it's always equal to zero (for floats). 
                        ***This means that the results are always rounded.
                    (ii)    it conforms to the integer vs. float rule.

            - integer by integer division gives an integer result. All other cases produce floats.

        *** This is very important: rounding always goes to the lesser integer.
                            The result of integer division is always rounded to the nearest integer value that is less than the real (not rounded) result.

        Note: 
            some of the values are negative. This will obviously affect the result. But how?

                The result is two negative twos. The real (not rounded) result is -1.5 in both cases. 
                However, the results are the subjects of rounding.
                  The rounding goes toward the lesser integer value, 
                                and the lesser integer value is -2, hence: -2 and -2.0.

            Integer division can also be called floor division.

"""
